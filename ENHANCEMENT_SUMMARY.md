### 2. CODE HUMANIZATION APPLIED

**Comments Made Natural & Conversational:**

Before: `# Set style for visualizations`
After: `# make the plots look clean and professional`

Before: `# Load CSV files using pandas read_csv with full file paths`
After: `# load the data`

Before: `# Calculate total crimes by state (aggregating across all years)`
After: `# get total crimes per state`

Before: `# Determine optimal number of clusters using elbow method`
After: `# test different numbers of clusters to find the best one`

**All Comments Updated:**
- Removed formal structure and markers
- Used casual, natural language
- Focused on clarity over formality
- Maintained professionalism without AI patterns

### 3. CHART IMPROVEMENTS

**New Chart Types Added:**
- ✓ Pie charts (distribution)
- ✓ Donut charts (layered visualization)
- ✓ Heatmaps (multi-dimensional)

## CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Humanization Examples

1. **Variable Names:** Natural and readable
   - `state_totals` ← clear and simple
   - `crime_names` ← descriptive
   - `pca_data` ← standard usage

2. **Comments:** Conversational and helpful
   ```python
   # make the plots look clean and professional
   # (instead of: # Set style for visualizations)
   
   # get total crimes per state
   # (instead of: # Calculate total crimes by state)
   ```

3. **Output Messages:** Natural and friendly
   ```python
   print("[SAVED] 01_top_crime_states.png")
   # (instead of: print("[COMPLETED] Visualization 01 saved successfully"))
   ```

4. **Code Structure:** Clear and logical
   - Sections separated by blank lines
   - Comments before each major step
   - Functions and workflows easy to follow
